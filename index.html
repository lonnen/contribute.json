        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>
        It's a project to find a common standard to describe all active Mozilla websites and projects.
        </p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p>
        You have a skill, say AngularJS or C++, but don't know which projects use this. If you could collect all the keywords
        from all projects using contribute.json you could easily find out which projects to approach with your friendly skill.
        </p>
        <p>
        You're browsing a site and discover that something is broken. You could just close the tab in anger or you can help out
        in some ways. Perhaps a good place is to file a bug report.
        <p>
        Or find out where the code is and go there directly and make a patch.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Or just find out which IRC channel, wiki page or mailing list people on the project hang out on.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        You're a developer asked to help on a project and you set to work. Instead of asking all the usual questions like "Where
        is the code?", "Where is the staging server?", "Do we have a mailing list?" you can simply look all this up in the
        /contribute.json file.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>How do I use it?</h1>
        <p>Write a minimal contribute.json file like this:</p>
        <code>
          {
            "name": "contribute.json",
            "description": "Standard to describe open source projects",
            "repository": {
              "url": "https://github.com/mozilla/contribute.json",
              "license": "MPL2"
            },
            "keywords": [
              "JSON",
              "Python",
              "Flask"
            ]
          }
        </code>
        <h1>Where do I put this?</h1>
        <p>
        A file named contribute.json at the root of the repository. If it's a website and you want web-based tools to also find
        it then serve it up as /contribute.json as well.
        </p>
